# Cookies

## Multiple cookies

If you want to use different cookies to send request to avoid hitting cookies limit, you could use `addCookies` to add more than one cookies to the client.

```javascript
const { Client } = require("genshin-kit.js");
// import { Client } from "genshin-kit.js"; (if you use typescript)

const client = new Client();
client.addCookies([{ ltoken: "LTOKEN", ltuid: "LTUID" }, {}, {}, {}]);
```

If you have more than one cookie, it will use the first, second, third... cookie to send request in order.

## Custom Cookies Manager

You can override the cookies manager by passing `cookieManager` to the constructor of client.
```javascript
const { Client, ClientCookieManager } = require("genshin-kit.js");
// import { Client , ClientCookieManager } from "genshin-kit.js"; (if you use typescript)

const manager = new ClientCookieManager();
manager.setCookie("LTUID", "LTOKEN");

const client = new Client({ cookieManager: manager });
```

You can use `ClientCookieManager` to manage cookies. It has some methods to help you manage cookies.
```javascript
// ...
manager.setCookie("", ""); // set cookie
manager.getAll(); // get all cookies
manager.delete(0); // delete cookie by index
manager.clear(); // clear all cookies
manager.get(); // get cookie to send request
```

### Get Cookies from browser(Chrome)

Prepare:

1. Install https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-cookies-secure

```bash
npm i chrome-cookies-secure
```

2. Open Chrome and login to the HoYoLab website
3. Get the cookie in ClientCookieManager

```javascript
// ...
manager.getBrowserCookie("Profile"); // you need to pass browser Profile
```

4. Done ✨
