# Cache

genshin-kit.js has cached most of responses from the API(except some routes you can check **API Reference**).
If the response is cached, it will return the cached response instead of sending a new request.

**Note**: In most of the cases, the key of cache is the `UID`.

```javascript
//...
<ROUTER>.cache.get("key");
```

## Custom Sweeper

You can customize it by passing `cacheOptions` to the constructor of router.

```javascript
//...
  cacheOptions: {
    maxAge: 60, // the cache will be deleted after 60 seconds
    maxSize: 0, // it wouldn't cache anythings
  },
//...
```
