# Client

Client contains all routes, and you could login with the ltoken and ltuid.

```ts
const client = new Client();

client.login("LTUID", "LTOKEN");
```

## Routes

Client contains all routes, and you could use it like this:
```ts
await client.<route>.<method>(<params>);
```
<Callout>
  You do not need to pass the ltoken and ltuid every time you want to send a request when using client.
</Callout>

## Cache Sweeper

Client has built-in cache sweeper that clear the cache automatically. You can customize the cache options by passing an object to the `cacheOptions` parameter when creating a new client.
### Custom Cache Sweeper

```javascript
const client = new Client({
  cacheOptions: {
    maxAge: 60, // the cache will be deleted after 60 seconds
    maxSize: 0, // it wouldn't cache anythings
  },
});
```

More information about caching can be found [here](/cache.mdx).

## Cookies Manager

Client could using cookies manager to store cookies. You can use the `addCookies` method to add more cookies.

```javascript
const { Client } = require("genshin-kit.js");
// import { Client } from "genshin-kit.js"; (if you use typescript)

const client = new Client();
client.addCookies([{ ltoken: "LTOKEN", ltuid: "LTUID" }, {}, {}, {}]);
```
