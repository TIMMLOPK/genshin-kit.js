# Cache

genshin-kit.js has cached most of responses from the API(except some routes you can check **API Reference**), so you can use cache instead making a new request.

**Note**: The key of cache is the UID, cookie or other things you use to make the request.

```javascript
//...
<ROUTER>.cache.get("key");
```

## Custom Sweeper

You can customize it by passing `cacheOptions` to the constructor of router.

```javascript
//...
  cacheOptions: {
    maxSize: 0, // it wouldn't cache anythings
//...
```
