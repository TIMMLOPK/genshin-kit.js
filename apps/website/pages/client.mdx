# Client

Client contains all routes in the library, and you can login with the ltoken and ltuid.

```ts
  const client = new Client();

  client.login("LTUID", "LTOKEN");
```

## Routes

To send a request to the API you can use the following routes:

Example:

```ts
    await client.sprialAbyss.fetch("UID");
```

The benefit of using client is that you don't have to pass the ltoken and ltuid every time you want to send a request.


## Cache Sweeper

Client has a cache sweeper that will clear the cache every 30 minutes. You can customize the sweeper. See [Caching](/caching.mdx) for more information.


## Cookies Manager
 
Client has a cookies manager with multiple cookies and more features.
