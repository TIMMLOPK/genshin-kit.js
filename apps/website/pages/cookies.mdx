## Multiple cookies

Sometime you want to use different cookies to avoid hitting cookies limit.You can use `addCookies` to add more cookies to the client.

If you provide more than one cookie, it will use the first , and then the second...

```javascript
const client = new Client();
client.addCookies([{ ltoken: "LTOKEN", ltuid: "LTUID" }, {}, {}, {}]);
```
