## Multiple cookies

If you want to use different cookies to send request to avoid hitting cookies limit, you could use `addCookies` to add more than one cookies to the client.

```javascript
const client = new Client();
client.addCookies([{ ltoken: "LTOKEN", ltuid: "LTUID" }, {}, {}, {}]);
```

If you have more than one cookie, it will use the first , and then the second...
