# Cache
genshin-kit.js has cached all responses from the API(except `RedeemCode`), so you can use it without making a request to the API.

**Note**: The key of cache is the UID, cookie or other things you use to make the request.
```javascript
const client = new Client();
client.[ROUTE_NAME].cache.get("key");
```

Client have a global sweeper for cleaning the cache, you can customize it by passing `cacheOptions` to the constructor.
```javascript
const client = new Client({
    cacheOptions: {
        maxAge: 60, // the cache will be deleted after 60 seconds
        maxSize: 0, // it wouldn't cache anythings
    },
});
```
