# Daily rewards checkIn

## Geetest of checkIn

Since HoYoLab updated the checkIn API, you may trigger the geetest CAPTCHA.You need to solve the captcha to get the rewards.

<Callout>Genshin-kit.js wouldn't help you to solve geetest, you need to solve it manually.</Callout>

If you want to solve the geetest when it tiggers, you can use the following code:

```js
await client.dailyReward.checkIn({
  geetestCallback: (challenge, gt) => {
    // solve the captcha here
    return { validate: "xxx", seccode: "xxx" };
  },
});
```

When you solve the geetest, Genshin-kit.js will send new request to the server with the `validate` and `seccode` you returned.
Otherwise, it will return status `geetest triggered`.
